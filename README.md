# Book-Website
I created this website through html, css, bootstrap, php, and javascript. 
Also utilizes SQL through a database on postgre in order to add, delete and update books. Database also manages users and their logins.
I used nodejs and express to help implement the website with ease as well as visual studio to assist in the ease of managing and updating files.
In order to implement the page fully need to install node_modules as well. Then you can run it on localhost: 3000 through writing npm start on the command line. An email and password that works is username: bob@fun.com and password:bobbbbbbbb
